# Slither.io ML Bot

## Installation instructions

**NOTE: these instructions are for installing the bot at a production-ready, fully working and a fully tested state, which is recommended. For the latest bleeding edge code, which may not be fully tested, refer to the bot.user.js file in the current default develop branch as the instructions below refer the bot file in the master branch.**

Get a userscript manager, such as violentmonkey or tampermonkey.

Once you have a userscript manager, copy the bots code from this repo and put it into a new userscript in the userscript manager.

Go to [slither.io](http://slither.io/), and enjoy!
